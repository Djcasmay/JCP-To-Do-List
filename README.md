# JCP-To-Do-List
To do list I made in class.
A simple to-do list that allows you to, Add a task to the to-do list, View the current to-do list, Mark a task as completed. Remove a task from the to-do list, Remove all tasks from the to-do list, Sort the list alphabetically, Print the # of Items on the To-do List
