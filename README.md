# JCP-To-Do-List
To do list I made in class.

A simple to-do list that allows you to, Add a task to the to-do list, View the current to-do list, Mark a task as completed, Edit a task in the to-do list, Remove a task from the to-do list, Remove all tasks from the to-do list, Sort the list alphabetically, and Print the # of Items on the To-do List. 

When the code is run a menu will show the options of what you can do and you will enter the number next to the task and it will perform that task.
